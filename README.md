# Notes on the exercises

## Day 1

Part 1 very easy.

Part 2 could not find math solution :/ Had to do basic solution with counting.

## Day 2

Part 1 very easy.

Part 2 the algo was straightforward, had a few stupid errors, fixed easily.

## Day 3

Part 1 very easy.

Part 2 easy algorithm but took me some time to get the correct sub lists with the list indices :/

## Day 4

Part 1 very easy, had fun.

Part 2 too easy! Adds nothing to the first part in terms of complexity.

## Day 5

Part 1 very easy.

Part 2 found a solution very easily, but it was not working because the input number are too big.
Worked on a second solution, took me a while to get it right. 

## Day 6

Part 1 very easy.

Part 2 easy. I did thousands of algos like this in school :)

## Day 7

Part 1 seemed easy, for some reason I could not make it work. Changed approach and found a solution using the indexes.
Then I found also the solution with the lists, looking at the next line instead of the previous one.

Part 2 not so difficult one I solved the first one :)
